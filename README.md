# Contact-form---sending-email
I want to have a contact section in my website where anybody can contact me by sending an email to me. I have seen many tutorials and various ways of doing this but it keeps failing. I do not have much understanding of PHP or Javascript and thus cannot really check others solutions on the PHP part. Please help me ace this!!
